# FormValidator

The project was created independently, following the guidelines provided in the OpanujJS course on Przeprogramowani.pl. As a part of my learning process, I incorporated Bootstrap for styling, and included an error message window in the form, along with appropriate toasts that appear when the form is filled out incorrectly, when the fetch fails, and when the fetch is successful, providing notification about the success of the form submission.

Furthermore, I added TypeScript to the project as another aspect of my learning process. For deployment, I utilized Vite.
