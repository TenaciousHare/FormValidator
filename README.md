# FormValidator

Second approach to the form validation project. Project created for the course "OpanujJS" from Przeprogramowani.pl

Here I use a Vite for deploy, and Bootstrap for styling.

## ToDo

1. Separate responsibilities. The Validator class has become responsible for handling everything that happens with the form.
